# Interactive Blog

This is a interactive blog application that directly reads and displays Markdown files from the `/posts` directory.

## Features

- Reads README.md files from the `/posts` directory
- Supports Markdown content with syntax highlighting
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Category filtering
- Image path processing

## Directory Structure

The blog expects posts to be organized in the following structure:

\`\`\`
/posts
  /post-slug-1
    /README.md
    /imgs
      /image1.jpg
      /image2.png
  /post-slug-2
    /README.md
    /imgs
      /image1.jpg
\`\`\`

## Markdown Format

Each README.md file should include frontmatter with metadata about the post. Example:

\`\`\`markdown
---
title: "My Blog Post Title"
created_time: "2024-05-22T00:00:00.000Z"
last_edited_time: "2024-05-22T00:00:00.000Z"
cover_image: "./imgs/cover.jpg"
icon_emoji: "üìù"
categories: ["Category1", "Category2"]
---
